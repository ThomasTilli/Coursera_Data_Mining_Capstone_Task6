# Coursera Data Mining Capstone Task6
This is my solution for the Coursera Data Mining Capstone Task 6.  It is about text classification - for details see the pdf document.
To run the code unzip the zipped data file and set the path in the code accordingly to the directory where you save the code and the data.

For this task a Kaggle like competition was used and I finaly got the highest score. As you can see from the code I used a logistic 
regression classifier with elastic net penalty.
